            <h3>Reading 1: How to Crit</h3>
            <p> 
                1. A lot of the time, I struggle with feeling like the feedback I have is 'wrong', because I don't consider myself an authority on whatever the subject matter is. So more often than not I end up just nodding my head and giving out compliments since I'm worried any criticism I have is 'incorrect'.
            </p>
            <p>                
                2. If I'm the only receiving said critique I try to consider all advice from different perspectives. I'd give it a try, but if I feel like the changes were worse than the original, I think I'd probably disregard it. It's always worth giving it a shot though, since sometimes things look a lot better on paper than in your head (and vice versa).

                3. I think getting other people's perspectives on your work is SUPER important when you've been working on a piece and your perception of it might be skewed from staring at it for so long. Especially if the work is meant to be viewed by a lot of other people, which most work is, what's obvious/important to you might not come across to other people, and the message you're trying to convey might be lost. Different views and suggestions that you might not have ever thought of on your own all work towards improving the piece.ss, along with a handful of other single-serve sites from last semester that I remembered. This one in particular, from the 
                typographic website pdf, stuch out to me.

            <h3>Reading 2: What Screens Want</h3>
            <p>
                1. Like the article mentioned, I feel like it's hard to say that one is strictly 'better' than the other since it's mainly an aesthetic choice. Flat designs aren't restricted by mimicking real-like objects, they're more consistent, they're cleaner and often easier to develop/less expensive. Meanwhile, skeuomorphic designs can make UI interactions more obvious since there is a real life equivalent to each button and immediately tells the user how to interact with the design. However, since software is so prevalent these days and overall software literacy is much higher than it was a decade ago, we don't really need skeuomorphic designs to teach users how to interact anymore. Not that those types of designs don't have their place in the world, maybe some happy mix of both skeuo + flat, but overall I think flat designs offer more opportunities for creativity and look less clunky. It just takes a good UX designer to avoid making it look boring/unreadable.

                2. A zoopraxiscope is a device from the 1800s where a sequence of images were printed onto a glass disc, and when the disc span, it created the illusion of movement/animation. It was kind of a precursor to animated gifs, ones that loop over and over again that live on the web. Another example could be stop-motion animation, which inspired a lot of digital aesthetics that kind of try to replicate the choppy/low framerate animation style; what comes to mind immediately are videos in which there is a looping background of paper texture that changes 4-5 times a second, trying to mimic the look and feel of stop motion animation.

                3. I think that 'flux' is the main thing that differentiates screens from traditional media; the capacity for change, and I believe that without it, there isn't much that separates it from print. A static webpage is not much different than a printed poster after all; it doesn't make use of the main advantage that screens have, which is their ability to change. But even that static website could move and respond depending on things like the width of the screen, or the device being used to observe it, and it might have hyperlinks that change colour when you hover over it; and all of that is still flux. All of these elements come together to make a site either more engaging or more accessible. These little moving interactions help guide and engage the viewer, and I feel like it's the main reason why you'd choose a digital medium over a physical one.

            <h3>Reading 3: Touring Complete User</h3>
            <p>
                1. She thinks that it's an important word, because it distinguishes the fact that you are using a software program, whether it is 'invisible' or not. Getting rid of the word 'user' in favour or something like 'people' is to destroy the distinction between the user, someone who did not write the program they are using, versus something like the developer. In some situations it's a good reminder to companies that the user is human, and to cater to humanistic needs during the design process, but the separation is still important. With that distinction gone, she argues that we could lose our rights as users; to offer feedback for improved software that we pay for, and to see the computer.

            <p>

                2. She describes her ideal internet user as a 'Turing Complete User', referencing the Alan Turing's Universal Machine that can solve any problem given an infinite amount of time. In a similar vein, these users are able to accomplish whatever goal they set out to do with the tools they have at hand, regardless of the original purpose of each tool. They can figure out a way to do what they want even if there isn't something built specifically to cater to that need.
            </p>
            <p>
                The universal user doesn't have to be a tech wiz or a hacker, they are just a normal person whose relationship with the web and technology is a working one, and this who makes their online experience a personal one. They might have their own regime, and it might not be the most effective or the most efficient way of doing something, but it is uniquely their way of doing it. And it gets done.
            </p>
            <p>
                

                3. There's two camps I can think of for this. One, a lot of software meant to be used as a certain tool can be repurposed in many different ways. Instead of using OneNote, you could simple use a Word document as your notebook for the semester. You might use that OneNote program as a personal diary. Personally, I use a program called Notion as my online planner; and it has some weird quirks to it, like the fact that I can't create columns within columns specifically UNLESS I create a table, then drag a text box over to the table, and one to the side of it, then delete the table (etc). That weirdness is where the user gets creative and fills in the gaps.

                Another is hardware limitations. When I work in my illustration program of choice, and I want  to create, say, an animation, the program itself is only able to export the frames into a video if none of them are transparent. If I want a gif, or an mp4 with transparency, I have to export each frame as a png and edit them together myself, in a different program.

            <h3>Reading 4: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge            </h3>
            <p>
                1. A lot of it comes down to capitalism (haha, but really). Social media aside, things like squarespace/wix, etc, and recent graphic design trends, mean that a ton of websites look very same-y. There's little creativity left in the field due to the trendy nature of design and guidelines in place to make sure the user has an easy time navigating. After all, if websites all have the same Look, it becomes much easier to know which button to click to do what you want it to, right? This kind of calls back to the previous reading, about Turing Complete Users. Maybe it's a good thing for websites to be more confusing, or difficult to navigate; maybe that navigation could be incorporated as part of the experience. Schwulst compares websites to the art gallery in which your work, the art, is hosted. The layout of that space is ever changing and modified to help support that artwork. I agree with her 100%, and it's part of the reason I wanted to take this course; I was interested in creating a portfolio site that didn't look like a carbon copy of the thousands other out there.
