                    Chapter XII: <br> Website as an Unfinished Book
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Sometimes we get fixated on things and work on them tirelessly, and then lose interest overnight. The same goes for a website, where bits and pieces of it 
                    might be meticulously put together and formatted to look the way we want; the 'important' bits, and the rest is left for a later time that never comes. Whether 
                    that's become you get busy, or you forget about it to start a new project, or you just give up on it entirely because after looking at the next morning it just looks 
                    awful, who's to say.

                    It's a bit like being heavily invested in a book, but getting busy, and not wanting to pick it back up a week later because you've forgotten where you were. 
                    Or like stopping right before the last few levels of a video game.
