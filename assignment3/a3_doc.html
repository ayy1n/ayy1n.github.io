                My final site is a colourful, single-serve website that allows the user to generate gradients based on the width and height of the box it's contained in. Some of the 
                aesthetic inspiration includes colour palette generators, pantone colour cards, neon lights.

            <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
            <p> 
                I had trouble getting an idea for this project by trying to find inspiration directly from are.na or instagram. Instead, I looked 
                back on some of the examples that were shown in class, along with a handful of other single-serve sites from last semester that I remembered. This one in particular, from the 
                typographic website pdf, stuch out to me.

                I love how bright the colours are and how the copy is jarring to look at, and it's very 'in your face'. I took some inspiration from that and, thinking of my prompt, 
                figured I could build a grid system and resize the tiles around.
            </p>

            <h3>INITIAL CONCEPT</h3>
            <p>
                My first idea was something akin to Mad-Libs, where I would have a bunch of copy in these tiles that the user could resize and drag around to get the word/letters of their 
                choosing, and it would have a sort of ransom note quality to it. Alternatively, I'd lean into the 'scrapbook' concept and insert a lot of photographs/paintings, allowing the 
                user to resize and crop those to their liking into a collage.
            </p>       

            <h3>PROTOTYPE PROCESS</h3>
            <p>
                First thing was to implement divs with the ability to resize, couresty of the jqueryUI library.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew that I was going to use a grid, table, or a flexbox or some kind to organize all my elements. I started off experimenting a bit with each, getting attached to the idea 
                of the flexbox, but issues kept cropping up over and over that I thought would be easy to deal with.

            <p>
                One of the biggest problems I had was finding a way to resize all elements in line with the current element so they would share the same width; there were so many 
                unexpected issues, and weird ways I tried to fix it; i.e. using a variable to store the current div's width, then setting each div with the same x-position's css to have the 
                same width... It didn't really work.
            </p>

            <p>
                I spent a long time just trying to troubleshoot.

            <p> I did, eventually, figure out how to fix that height issue after scouring the internet for hours and studying up on a lot of jquery nomenclature!</p>

            <h3>SCRAPPING, FIXING, REDOING</h3>

            <p>
                I then ran into a second issue, where any text I placed inside the box wouldn't wrap properly, and the div wouldn't shrink any further than the longest word in that box. 
                That kind of ruined the whole 'mad libs' idea and it was very frustrating, I tried everything from overflow: hidden, to white-space: nowrap, etc... but nothing seemed to 
                work. After some testing I figured out that it was because of the way I was nesting my divs, but at this point I had no idea how to fix the issue without unsolving the 
                height issue, so I thought about other ways I could take this project with the base I had.

                After staring enough at the colours on the screen and thinking back to p5.js I learned last semester, I went with changing the colour of the boxes based on resizing. And 
                it worked like a charm.

            <p>
                It looked a little flat, so I decided to add a second hue with a different mapping for the bottom of a gradient. This really helped with the visual appeal and gave the user 
                a lot more room to play around with getting different results.
            </p>

            <p>
                For final details, I added some intro text that fades out once the user resizes their first box (just in case), and I made sure that all of my divs looked good no matter the 
                size of the viewport. I used percentages and viewport height liberally to achieve this. As a closing thought, I'd love to make the handles bigger, but every time I tried 
                resizing them to make it easier for people to grab them, it just wouldn't work. I'll have to look into that more later.
